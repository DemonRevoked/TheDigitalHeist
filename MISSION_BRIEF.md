# THE DIGITAL HEIST
## A La Casa de Papel Inspired CTF

### 🎭 THE MISSION

The Professor has assembled a crew for the most ambitious heist ever attempted—not of gold or currency, but of **truth itself**.

A covert intelligence agency known as **The Directorate** has built **Δ₀ (Delta-Zero)**, a mass-surveillance AI system capable of monitoring global communications, rewriting digital records, and predicting dissent before it happens. They've hidden all evidence of its existence inside a fortified **Digital Vault**, protected by cryptographic barriers, web defenses, and autonomous AI guardians.

Your mission: **Infiltrate the vault. Expose the system. Free the truth.**

---

### 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVE

As part of the Professor's hand-picked crew, you will:

- **Break through cryptographic locks** guarding classified intelligence
- **Infiltrate web systems** containing evidence of corruption
- **Reverse-engineer surveillance tools** to understand the enemy
- **Outsmart AI guardians** designed to protect the system
- **Extract the final proof** that brings down The Directorate

Every challenge brings you one step closer to the vault.
Every flag is a piece of evidence.
Every breakthrough reveals another layer of deception.
