=== DF-02: Burned USB ===

Narrative:
A half-destroyed USB stick was pulled from a Directorate cleanup burn bag.
Your job: carve and reconstruct what they tried to erase.

Files:
- burned-usb.img

Objective:
- Recover BOTH values hidden in the image:
  - KEY:<challenge key>
  - FLAG:TDHCTF{carved_network_node}

Hints (in-story):
- The cleanup unit didn’t wipe the drive clean — it interrupted the truth.
- Look for a “core document” that still has structure, then work outward.
- Expect deliberate gaps and noise inserted to break simple carving.
- The most obvious flag-shaped string is not the real one.
