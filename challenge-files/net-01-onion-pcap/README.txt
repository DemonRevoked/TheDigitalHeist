=== NET-01: Onion PCAP — Header Whispers ===

You recovered a capture from a Directorate switch span-port.
A rogue engineer is signaling an internal AI node.

Files:
- net-01-onion-pcap.pcap

Objective:
- Recover BOTH values hidden in the capture:
  - KEY: <challenge key>
  - FLAG: TDHCTF{...}

Notes:
- The obvious stream contains a decoy.
- The real message is not in payload.
- Order is not capture order.
