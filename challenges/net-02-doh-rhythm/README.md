# NET-02 — DoH Rhythm (HTTP Header Exfiltration)

This challenge is **offline**. Players download the PCAP from `challenge-files/net-02-doh-rhythm/` and recover the flag.

Author notes:
- Generated by `src/generate_pcap.py` (pure Python, no external deps).
- The intended solution requires extracting Base64-encoded data from HTTP request headers (User-Agent field).
- This demonstrates a **real-world technique** used by malware and APT groups to bypass DLP systems.
