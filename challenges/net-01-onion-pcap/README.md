# NET-01 — Onion PCAP (Header Whispers)

This challenge is **offline**. Players download the PCAP from `challenge-files/net-01/` and recover the flag.

Author notes:
- The PCAP is generated by `src/generate_pcap.py` (pure Python, no external deps).
- The intended solution requires peeling GRE and extracting a covert channel from header fields.
