# NET-01 — Onion PCAP (DNS Tunneling Exfiltration)

This challenge is **offline**. Players download the PCAP from `challenge-files/net-01-onion-pcap/` and recover the flag.

Author notes:
- The PCAP is generated by `src/generate_pcap.py` (pure Python, no external deps).
- The intended solution requires identifying DNS tunneling exfiltration and extracting Base64-encoded data from DNS query names.
- This demonstrates a **real-world technique** used by malware (Iodine, dnscat2) and APT groups.
- The exfil domain contains a storyline hint: `*.blueprint.professor.royalmint.local`.
